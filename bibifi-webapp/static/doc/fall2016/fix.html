<h1>Fix it</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The fix-it round is an opportunity to gain build-it points back.</p>
<p>You will be given access to the breaks against your code. It may be
that many of these breaks, though superficially different, target the
same underlying flaw. Therefore, when you fix a flaw, several of the
breaks may no longer work. These will be unified: You will only lose
points for one of them, not all of them. Therefore, some of the points
you have already lost (for all of the duplicate breaks) will be restored.</p>
<p>Even if you are not in the running to win the build-it competition, it
is <em>in your interests to fix your code.</em></p>
<p>First of all, you may be in a better position that you realize. In
past contests, we have found that one fix addresses six breaks, on
average; that's a pretty good bump to your score.</p>
<p>Second, increasing your score increases the chances of passing with
distinction, if you are a Coursera participant. Moreover, a higher
total placement in the contest will be of interest to future
employers. </p>
<p>For open participants, increasing your score can move you into a
higher prize bracket. Everyone has the chance to win a prize (we
randomly choose a single winner for each bracket), but the higher
brackets have more money on the line.</p>
<h2>Fix setup</h2>
<p>To set up your repository for the fix-it round, you will need to download the zip of your build-it submission from the Builder's Code page on the website and place it in the <em>root of your repository</em>. 
Then perform the following commands from the root of your repository (replace NN with your team id, which is an integer):</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fix
unzip NN.zip
mv NN fix/code
rm -rf fix/code/.git
git add fix
git commit -m 'fix start'
</code></pre>
<p>This ensures that you start from your final build-it submission. 
The organizers will make all of the break-it submissions against your team available.
You can download the break-it submissions <a href="https://builditbreakit.org/static/doc/fall2016/fix.zip">here</a>. </p>
<h2>Fix submissions</h2>
<p>Your fixes should address individual break submissions. </p>
<p>A fix should address the root cause of a particular test case failing. The fix should be the smallest change you can make to get this test to pass, while addressing the general underlying issue in your code. Now it may be that the change you make to fix one test case causes other test cases (e.g., those submitted other different teams) to pass as well. If so, then you will get points back for those tests.</p>
<p>When you submit your fix, you will have to explain why what you changed addresses a single issue related to a particular test. We will then judge whether we agree that your changes are really covering the issue uncovered by this test. If we disagree, the fix will be disallowed and no points will be given back.</p>
<p>To submit a fix, fix your implementation in <code>fix/code</code>.
Commit this fix and note the git commit hash. This is your <em>fix submission</em>.
Each directory inside the <code>fix</code> folder (except for the <code>code</code> directory) will specify a fix. 
Create a json filed called <code>fix.json</code> in this fix submission's directory (ie. <code>fix/myfirstfix/fix.json</code>) like the following: </p>
<pre><code>{
    "commit": "fdb3186c9a2b6adcb5ddd96b844123331ba3832c",
    "breaks": [563,123,42]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>commit</em> attribute indicates the git commit hash of the fix's commit. 
The <em>breaks</em> attribute indicates the break submission ids that are being fixed. 
You will only get points back for breaks that you explicitly include in the json file. 
Any changes to a fix directory will be ignored once it has already been commited.
You must create a new fix directory if you want to make modifications (team leaders can delete the old fix submission on the contest website). </p>
<p>Your justification for the fix will be stored in a separate text file called <code>description.txt</code> in the fix's directory (ie. <code>fix/myfirstfix/description.txt</code>). 
Please reference one of the breaks listed in your json file, explaining how your fix applies to precisely the issue raised in this test. The justification file should up to 500 words long.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>you should make no commits to your <code>fix/code</code> directory that are not fix submissions</strong> with a corresponding json file. If you do, we will <strong>disqualify all subsequent fixes.</strong> If you want to develop a fix collaboratively, you can always change the code in your original <code>build</code> directory until it works and then commit the difference in the <code>fix/code</code> directory.</p>
<p>Once pushed, fixes will be run on the required correctness tests from build-it, as well as the break-it tests that are claimed to be fixed. 
If the fix passes all these tests, the fix will be marked for judgement; otherwise it will be rejected. 
We will judge fixes at the end of the fix-it round. </p>
<h2>Disputes</h2>
<p>If you discover a break against your system that you believe is incorrect, write a justification for why you think it is invalid. The justification (no more than 100 words per test case) should indicate why your system's behavior is acceptable according to the spec, even if the oracle behaves differently. 
Team leaders can submit break disputes on the break's submission page. 
We will consider them during the judging phase. </p>
