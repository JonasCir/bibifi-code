## Current state

**API is still no stable.**
We're looking to stabilize the API after the next release (0.4.0.0)

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute please see any issue tagged with "help wanted".
Make sure to submit your PR's against the `dev` branch.

Please consider filling an Issue first and discuss design decisions and implementation details before
writing any code. This is so that no development cycles go to waste on implementing a feature that
might not get merged either because of implementation details or other reasons.
